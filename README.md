# P_Scan

Port scanning is part of the first phase of a penetration test and allows you to find all network entry points available on a target system. It is a tool(alternative to Nmap or Hping3) designed to probe a server or host for open ports. Such an application may be used by administrators to verify security policies of their networks and by attackers to identify network services running on a host and exploit vulnerabilities.
It can be used to identify available services running on a server.
